## [Assignment](https://elearning.di.unipi.it/mod/assign/view.php?id=6189) of Peer to Peer Systems and Blockchains A.A. 2018-19 (UniPi)
It has been implemented the construction of the DHT defined in [Kademlia](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/~petar/papers/maymounkov-kademlia-lncs.pdf) subsequently used to study the characteristics of the graph that is created between all the nodes of the network. Therefore not all the protocol (the whole part of saving information) has been implemented.
